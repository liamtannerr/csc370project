1. **Review and Optimize FDs and Keys**

      1. Identify all functional dependencies 
      2. Validate and optimize keys and superkeys 

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: All functional dependencies and keys are listed and explained in a text file. All keys and superkeys are optimized.

2. **Obtain large dataset**
    1. Explore options like Kaggle and UberEats API
    2. Properly import dataset into our database.

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: A large dataset is successfully imported into the database.

3. **BCNF Normalization and Decomposition**

    1. Check for BCNF violations 
    2. Apply decomposition techniques 
    3. Verify decomposed tables with natural joins 

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: NO BCNF violations in our database, no issues when joining decomposed tables.

4. **Implement Referential Integrity Constraints**

    1. Document referential integrity constraints 
    2. Implement foreign keys with desired policies

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: Referential integrity constraints clearly described in document, foreign keys fully implemented in database.

5. **Develop Complex SQL Queries**

    1. Write and optimize complex SQL queries using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proof of complex SQL queries running successfully and providing meaningful results recorded in a text/image file.
 
6. **Use SQL DML for Data Manipulation**

    1. Create and test SQL DML statements 

    EVALUATION CRITERIA: SQL DML statements are successfully created and tested, modifying the contents of tables as intended.

7. **Testing and Validation**

    1. Perform thorough testing of the database 
    2. Validate data integrity and query results

    EVALUATION CRITERIA:
      1. The database passes all tests and data integrity is maintained.
      2.  Query results are accurate and meet the requirements.
